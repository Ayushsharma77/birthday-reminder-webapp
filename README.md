## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Secure User Authentication**:
    * Users can create a unique account through the registration page.
    * Passwords are securely hashed using the `password_hash` function.
    * A robust login system verifies credentials using `password_verify`.

* **Reminder Management (CRUD)**:
    * **Create**: Users can add new birthday reminders with a name and date of birth. The form uses a jQuery UI datepicker for easy date selection.
    * **Read**: All upcoming birthdays are displayed on a central dashboard, sorted by the soonest date. A separate page lists all reminders in a table.
    * **Delete**: Users can delete their own reminders, with security checks to prevent deleting reminders owned by other accounts.

* **Dual Notification System**:
    * **In-Page Notifications**: The navigation bar automatically displays a prominent card on the homepage if a contact has a birthday on the current day.
    * **Desktop Push Notifications**: The application uses the browser's Notification API to send native desktop notifications, checking for birthdays every hour. This is powered by a `check_birthdays.php` backend script that provides the necessary data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A local web server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
* PHP
* MySQL Database

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
2.  Navigate to your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` in XAMPP) and place the cloned folder there.
3.  Import the database schema by importing the `db_birthday_reminder.sql` file into your MySQL database through a tool like phpMyAdmin. This will create the `accounts` and `users` tables.
4.  Create a `config.php` file in the project's root directory by copying the contents of `config.php.example`.
5.  Open `config.php` and enter your local database credentials (username, password).
6.  Launch your local web server and navigate to the project directory in your browser.
